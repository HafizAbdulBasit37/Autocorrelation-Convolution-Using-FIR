# Autocorrelation-Convolution-Using-FIR
This repo provides a parameterized Verilog module that can compute either **correlation** or **convolution** using the same shift-register structure (newest sample at index 0). The design supports a programmable delay (`DELAY`) and 16-bit signed samples, with 2Ã— data width accumulation.
